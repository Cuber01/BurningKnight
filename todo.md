# sand & oil 

* menu is kinda broken with gamepad, input is also not blocked
* Allow to use images in ui string, get some gamepad and keyboard buttons going

* Ui hearts are not noticable
* Hold melee weapon to throw it 
* Enemies should only spawn when player enters, and get removed, when you to away
* rework dialog look? dialog system with good old popup like in old versions of bk for long dialogs?
* seed input remove/rework, it doesnt affect the run?

* we need inventory in pause menu, like in revita
* player can respawn without a weapon or with op weapon from last run
* +hp up when items mod smth your stat on your head

* curse of ??? (do not know consumable counts)
* curse of ??? (items hidden)

* discord rpc where??
* items that give curse
* item that makes your bullet size change over time (both ways (2 items))

* player stats:
 + use rate

* troll bombs
* hitting frozen enemy should let it slide a lot more around the room than usual
* Enemies / rooms drop rewards (bombs, keys, coins)
* mother slime body is not removed!!!!

## general

+ lava:
 * tile lighting: figure it out
 * dont forget little bursts of light for guns and stuff
 * lava should be drawn over the shadows
 * particles for lava like in pd
 * fix lavafall colors
 * fix fire particle changing the render state so much

* idol room update, make them smaller, idol also will keep on spawning mobs with each load
* room cleared effect
* picking up hearts should give more feedback
* Low health indicator
* juice up pistons (entity + tile mix for rendering, we need inbetweens for sure)
* spice up bullets (different textures for different enemies)
* we need more secret room layouts
* shields

* Tile interactions
 * burning terrain
 * ember after burnt stuff
 * liquids should have smaller hitbox
 
* Buffs
 * poison (green poison drops dropping from you, some slowness)
 * slowness
 * speed
 * charmed hearts particles
 
* gases??
* figure out what to do with classes? (like potatoo, it doesnt do anything for melee, etc)

#### Polish

* animate items on player head better, also dont stack em, display count 
* animate item pickup / appearance
* look into doors drawing at proper depth
* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Reflections in the water
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* Explode item stand to replace the item with trash? :thinking:
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* fire trap, could use a simular sprite to pd/spikes, emits fire when you stand on it, some just emit on timer
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* bee hive room in the jungle (has tons of bees inside, has a special wall (wall b textured as honeycomb), maybe even with a miniboss?)

### Rooms

* falling floor room
* minigame rooms from rogue legacy
* crawled space
* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* Challenge room
* Cursed room
* trap rooms
* angel/devil rooms, I dont like the theme tho, think of smth else
* more secret rooms
* room, where you have an item blocked by bricks (aka chasms, but you cant roll through em), from isaac. has a small chance to spawn tho (pretty annoying), has no enemies

### things I promissed to do

* angel/devil rooms, I dont like the theme tho, rename into smth else
* secret seeds
* daily runs
* local coop up to 4 players
* twitch support
* steam cloud
