* make enemies in the room invincible while the player is not inside
* game doesnt save contantly? why does progress reset after crashes? (it looks like just the hub doesnt save)
* reroll machine hitbox too small
* explosions still can destroy axes (give it a 5 second cooldown till it spawns you a new one or smth)

* snow body still issue with bullets?
* if you rapidly teleport away with duck ring i think you can get stuck invincible

* bk still can become idle
* bomb shell makes hp diplay wrong
* items in chasms should dissappear
* if you respawn you can have no hp at all (broken shield/bloody shield)
* I was on the final boss and i noticed the boss door was unlocked deering the fight so i walked through it and this happened

* invis items back

* still can get not teleported to entrance (no entrance or smth?)
* pharaoh can tp near door and get all projectiles destroyed

* fix shot visual language (make it clear what bullets you cant reflect)
* you can clip into the achievement hall reward rooms

> issues with enemies being hard to see / hit cuz getting hidden in the walls
> can get stuck in the shop door when its locking (due to angry shopkeeper)
> Would be neat to have random items when using the shortcuts to give some fighting chance. Another use for emeralds like you pay 100 to start the floor with a random amount of treasure room items based on RNG and the shortcut used.
