# overscope

* custom voices for the new npcs
* save max hp for player. otherwise shield buddy is broken

* scourge { 
  - make face door actually teleport you, dissappear after 1 use, ask that you can enter only with >= 1 curse or 99 coins, a dark market
  - make portal door actually teleport you
  
  - a door, 
  - more coins should drop the more curse you have
  - room, that locks you in, till you choose one curse token (only if you have curse points, chance increases with the more curses you get)
 }
}

* content to place {
 + protochest
 + cursed room content 
 + black market content
}

* enemies {
 + mike
 + horror 
 + white eyes
 + bee hive needs a support, probs a tree
 + too much overall hp, too many enemies per room
}

* misc {
 + better hive gen on lvl 2
 + trees?
}

* fix {
 + weird glitch with the lock?? it kinda rotates or smth
}

# todo

* fix {
 + bugs {
  - maximized window bug on windows
  - game sometimes doesn't exit after closing
 }

 + visual {
  - the weapons go crazy when you point directly up or down
  - doors are hard to notice
 }

 + tutorial {
  - make the door after the sword a wall type, that you need to break by using your sword on it
 }

 + gamepad {
  - rumble doesn't always work? maybe its just not noticable enough
 }
}

* bk: {
 + fix how saving works with capturing ths bosses
}

* ui {
 + change how black bars work, all of that ingame ui that is pause stuff should render as a second time ui layer (and stop hiding ui elements if the game is just paused)
}

* audio {
 + bk fire sound (when near)
}

+ hub {
 + allow to layer in stuff for speical events
 + lock away the rest of the hub on the first time you enter it after tutorial?
}

##

* spawn chests/pickups in the levels

* duck interaction
* Implement basic loop after you defeat the boss
* more prefixes

* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

## general

* lava: {
 + tile lighting: figure it out
 + dont forget little bursts of light for guns and stuff
 + lava should be drawn over the shadows
 + particles for lava like in pd
 + fix lavafall colors
}

* Low health indicator
* juice up pistons (entity + tile mix for rendering, we need inbetweens for sure)
* shields

#### Polish

* animate items on player head better, also dont stack em, display count 
* animate item pickup / appearance
* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats
* player should go up (like jumping arc) when he is rolling

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* blue hearts, at least em

* teleport tile mechanic for some level
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run

* special secret music with 10% chance?
* a special reward for completing the level fast

* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?

### Rooms

* crawled space
* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* trap rooms
* more secret rooms
* new secret room designs
* altar from spelunky?

* secret level ith tons of shopkeepers, aka dark market from spelunky

### things I promissed to do

* secret seeds
* daily runs
* local coop up to 4 players
* twitch support
* steam rpc

### Machine Ideas

* Takes two weapons gives new 
* Buys weapons from you
* Health chest, can be mimic 
* Rework well into different structs
* machine: gives random stat up
