# TODO

### Important

* Allow to enter editor from in-game and back
* Finish save implementation
* Allow to place entities with editor
* Loading items should take their uses/rendering/other stuff from ItemRegistry

### Polish

* Water / liquid shader still has a 2-3 frames of other liquid overlapping
* Item pickup fx convert to -> "+ item name (count)"
* Animate item going to inventory
* Item stand has wrong item offsets
* Flash frame for guns
* Make bullets fly out from the right place
* Bullet shells

### Mechanics

* Implement overworld
* Infinite overworld?
* Add health component to chest
* Add explodable component to chest?
* Explode item stand to replace the item with trash? :thinking:

### Ideas

* Signs, you can write/read from them

### Clean up

* Move BurningBuff.Id somewhere else (other name), cause it hides Id field from Buff class
