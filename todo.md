* make reviving of player look epic (probs tps to the entrance)
* broken ankh respawn with 1 max hp
* idle anim for emerald golem as well as broken frame (pile of rocks or gone completely)
* bk doesnt appear propetly after defeating the head, camera goes wild (at least in boss rush)
* something is super weird going with items, they dissappeared in the boss room, but they still can be picked up?

* after killing bk head (with water bucket), imo there should be smth a bit more epic
* after killing bk head enemies/laser/bullets stay (at least with water bucket)
* reroll is buggy as nothing (it looks like item:changeInto is buggy, especially with d2 joppa)
* check if collector achievement works, weapon free, steam achievement sync doesnt work?

# bugs
