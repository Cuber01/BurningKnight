### big points that are needed before release (no overscope)

#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)

* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!
