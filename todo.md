* magnite works on 1 floor
* snail active item in the hub debuffs you (you arent supposed to be able to use active items in the hub)
* check gold dagger
* If you got 99 bombs and bombshell, you can't pick up more to refill the bomb hp.
* axe after reappearing: cant use it anymore
* make enemies in the room invincible while the player is not inside
* game doesnt save contantly? why does progress reset after crashes? (it looks like just the hub doesnt save)

* if you rapidly teleport away with duck ring i think you can get stuck invincible

* bk still can become idle
* bomb shell makes hp diplay wrong
* items in chasms should dissappear
* I was on the final boss and i noticed the boss door was unlocked deering the fight so i walked through it and this happened

* invis items back

* still can get not teleported to entrance (no entrance or smth?)
* pharaoh can tp near door and get all projectiles destroyed

* fix shot visual language (make it clear what bullets you cant reflect)
> Would be neat to have random items when using the shortcuts to give some fighting chance. Another use for emeralds like you pay 100 to start the floor with a random amount of treasure room items based on RNG and the shortcut used.
