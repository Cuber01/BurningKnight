desert gen gave up? no loading screen tips sometimes

* game stats in hub (best 3 runs, total deaths, etc)

* credits

ice {
 * frozen enemies/troll bomb
 * shooting tiles in ice biome should update transition
   + old level body did not delete

 * campfires in ice levels
}

* Library {
 * unique wall designs with teleporters
}

###

* highlight doors you not went through

+ active shop discount still discounts without the use
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing

### big points that are needed before release (no overscope)

slimes shouldnt all jump at the same time
* hub update
* credits
* achivement icons
* twitch chat integration
* localisation

#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)

* teleport tile mechanic for some level
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run

* a special reward for completing the level fast

* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!

### Rooms

* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* trap rooms
* altar from spelunky?
