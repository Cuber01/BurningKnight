* lock {
 * any exit from the dungeon till you play once
 * boss rush till you find an npc, you gotta pay 3 emeralds to attempt the rush, rush should not drop any emeralds
 * shortcuts, find an npc in the dungeon, you pay him resources (they stick between runs), he opens them. He spawns on the first level of the respectful shortcut
}

* line of sight for close dialog
* add tutorial shortcut into the hub

* achievements, like bk:tutorial, can get lost in between loading screens and never actually showup

* change how black bars work, all of that ingame ui that is pause stuff should render as a second time ui layer (and stop hiding ui elements if the game is just paused)
* death counter display (overall game stats)

* give a few items in the daily run, random weapon

ice {
 * frozen enemies/troll bomb
 * shooting tiles in ice biome should update transition
   + old level body did not delete

 * campfires in ice levels
}

* Library {
 * unique wall designs with teleporters
}

###

#### Polish

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)

}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)

* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run

* a special reward for completing the level fast

* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!

### Rooms

* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* trap rooms
* altar from spelunky?
