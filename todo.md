# TODO

### Important

* Fix iteractable component: when you end interact with one, it should auto highlight outline of the second one.
* Add knockback component
* Item stand: big sensor body

### Polish

* Water / liquid shader still has a 2-3 frames of other liquid overlapping
* Item pickup fx convert to -> "+ item name (count)"
* Animate item going to inventory
* Item stand has wrong item offsets

### Mechanics

* Add health component to chest
* Add explodable component to chest?
* Explode item stand to replace the item with trash? :thinking:
