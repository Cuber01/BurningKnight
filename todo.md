bk burning sfx plays while in loading
death counter display
guitar
glass weapons (sword, dagger)

fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)

feeling with chasms from pd
smoke texture gets super fast
some bg for item description popup
reference "collecting bullets" in item description
dunce hat should increase hub prices by 1 
active shop discount still discounts without the use
add some dialog to npcs when you save them (interact)
bk flavors (feelings)
players dont notice new shopkeepers

* fix {
 + the weapons go crazy when you point directly up or down

 + tutorial {
  - make the door after the sword a wall type, that you need to break by using your sword on it
 }

 + gamepad {
  - rumble doesn't always work? maybe its just not noticable enough
 }
}

* bk: fix how saving works with capturing ths bosses
* change how black bars work, all of that ingame ui that is pause stuff should render as a second time ui layer (and stop hiding ui elements if the game is just paused)
* rewamp death screen
* Low health indicator

 + allow to layer in stuff for speical events

}

##

* spawn chests/pickups in the levels

* duck interaction

* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

## general

* lava: {
 + tile lighting: figure it out
 + dont forget little bursts of light for guns and stuff
 + lava should be drawn over the shadows
 + particles for lava like in pd
 + fix lavafall colors
}

#### Polish

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats
* player should go up (like jumping arc) when he is rolling

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)

* teleport tile mechanic for some level
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run

* special secret music with 10% chance?
* a special reward for completing the level fast

* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!

### Rooms

* crawled space
* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* trap rooms
* altar from spelunky?

### things I promissed to do

* secret seeds
* daily runs
* local coop up to 4 players
* twitch support
* steam rpc

### Machine Ideas

* Buys weapons from you
* Health chest, can be mimic 
* machine: gives random stat up
