## general

+ lava:
 * tile lighting: figure it out
 * dont forget little bursts of light for guns and stuff
 * lava should be drawn over the shadows
 * particles for lava like in pd
 * fix lavafall colors
 * fix fire particle changing the render state so much

* Low health indicator
* juice up pistons (entity + tile mix for rendering, we need inbetweens for sure)
* spice up bullets (different textures for different enemies)
* shields

* projectile speed stat

#### Polish

* juice up guns aka nuclear throne, do the same with melee
* special door textures for shop and treasure room, maybe even boss room 
* animate items on player head better, also dont stack em, display count 
* animate item pickup / appearance
* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Reflections in the water
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats
* player should go up (like jumping arc) when he is rolling

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* blue hearts, at least em

* teleport tile mechanic for some level
* breakable chests
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run

* jungle rooms should be a tad smaller than the rest of the game?
* special secret music with 10% chance?
* a special reward for completing the level fast

* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* fire trap, could use a simular sprite to pd/spikes, emits fire when you stand on it, some just emit on timer
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* bee hive room in the jungle (has tons of bees inside, has a special wall (wall b textured as honeycomb), maybe even with a miniboss?)
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?

### Rooms

* falling floor room
* minigame rooms from rogue legacy
* crawled space
* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* Challenge room
* Cursed room
* trap rooms
* more secret rooms
* room, where you have an item blocked by bricks (aka chasms, but you cant roll through em), from isaac. has a small chance to spawn tho (pretty annoying), has no enemies
* new secret room designs

* secret level ith tons of shopkeepers, aka dark market from spelunky

### things I promissed to do

* secret seeds
* daily runs
* local coop up to 4 players
* twitch support
* steam rpc

### Machine Ideas

* Takes two weapons gives new 
* Buys weapons from you
* Health chest, can be mimic 
* Rework well into different structs
* machine: gives random stat up
