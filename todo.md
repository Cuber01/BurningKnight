* doors tile high lights sometimes
* active shop discount still discounts without the use

* ice 2 bug when no wall or floor is rendered

* gamepad still shakes even when set to none
* By rolling off the bridge, you can be respawned inside the area with the stairs to the boss rush area before you pay the guard the three emeralds. There is no way to get out without resetting the game,
* check: where when a scourge hides your health you get the achievment that you didnt loose a live on the floor

* boss bug out when you get dead
* same seed all the time on startup lol

# hub

}

###

* highlight doors you not went through
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels

### big points that are needed before release (no overscope)

#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* double item stand: 1 good 1 bad
* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!
