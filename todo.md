# todo

* check if audio settings works
* flashes (like lighting bolt zaps)
* rain

## audio

* switching between levels (dark out) should fade in/out music
* hide music disks around
* lowpass filter and somewhat responsible music? :(

## general

+ lava:
 * tile lighting: figure it out
 * dont forget little bursts of light for guns and stuff
 * lava should be drawn over the shadows
 * particles for lava like in pd
 * fix lavafall colors
 * fix fire particle changing the render state so much

* idol room update, make them smaller, idol also will keep on spawning mobs with each load
* room cleared effect
* picking up hearts should give more feedback
* Low health indicator
* curse mechanics (you get curse points, basically difficulty points, at 9 or 10 bk spawns, like he was before (chasing you all the time, except battle))
* juice up pistons (entity + tile mix for rendering, we need inbetweens for sure)
* menu screen needs shadows
* ellipses seem to be 1 tile less width and height??
* parallaxed decor in the chasms
* buff icons
* spice up bullets (different textures for different enemies)
* we need more secret room layouts

### future bk ideas

* worm
* ghost

### beta bugs

* openal crash
* bk missile projectiles have no sprite??? wrong depth, maybe?

### todo

* shields
* game intro

* Tile interactions
 * burning terrain
 * ember after burnt stuff
 * liquids should have smaller hitbox
 
* Buffs
 * poison (green poison drops dropping from you, some slowness)
 * slowness
 * speed
 * charmed hearts particles
 * frozen
 * buff icons?
 
* gases??

* implement stats
* lighting bolts
* figure out what to do with classes? (like potatoo, it doesnt do anything for melee, etc)

#### Polish

* look into doors drawing at proper depth
* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Reflections in the water
* Splashes on the water
* Walls after explosion should be "a bit more broken?"
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* Explode item stand to replace the item with trash? :thinking:
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)

* fire trap, could use a simular sprite to pd/spikes, emits fire when you stand on it, some just emit on timer
* cool bonus for killing bk without dropping a single white chunk (health chunk, aka non stop kill)
* make bk himself sign!!!!
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Signs, you can write/read from them
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation
* use cota tracks as disks to feature in the game and change in the gramaphone
* bee hive room in the jungle (has tons of bees inside, has a special wall (wall b textured as honeycomb), maybe even with a miniboss?)

### Rooms

* Room, where you press lever/button to open/close chasm
* Challenge room
* Cursed room
* rooms with preasure plates
* rooms with switches
* trap rooms
* room, where you have an item blocked by bricks (aka chasms, but you cant roll through em), from isaac. has a small chance to spawn tho (pretty annoying), has no enemies
* angel/devil rooms, I dont like the theme tho, rename into smth else

### things I promissed to do

* angel/devil rooms, I dont like the theme tho, rename into smth else
* secret seeds
* daily runs
* local coop up to 4 players
* twitch support
* steam cloud
