# bugs

* rolling spikes can stop (rework their move logic)
* mobs shouldnt drop anything on death from chasm
* rework tree spawns
* hive can spawn bees into the wall (they move too fast?)
* bk and orbital sfx glitch out during loading
* music goes out?
* doors tile high lights sometimes
* active shop discount still discounts without the use
* web doesnt affect mobs
* ice 2 bug when no wall or floor is rendered

* people still get that exit after loading (see itch)

# hub

* challenge room in jungle is so hard with all the hives
* check if i broke gameover screen?

* leaderboard display {

}

* game stats in hub (best 3 runs, total deaths, etc)
* challanges
!!! * add eye of chthulu pet
* 3 save slots (aka parrarel universes)

#

* shop should start small and grow with donations?
* show only last 6 or so items, allow to see more in pause menu
* this is a secret to everyone easter egg in hub?

* when you pickup glass, fix your broken glass gun/sword
* josh like jokes in settings, with "sound effect"

ice {
 * frozen enemies/troll bomb
 * following troll bomb

   + old level body did not delete

}

###

* highlight doors you not went through
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels

### big points that are needed before release (no overscope)

* add soundtrack package to steam
* localisation
* twitch chat integration

#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* double item stand: 1 good 1 bad
* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* enemies/rooms/other stuff that doesn't happen/appear every run
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* MIMIIIICS!
