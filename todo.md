### Before v0.0.0.4

* figure out what to do with classes? (like potatoo, it doesnt do anything for melee, etc)
* Enemies / rooms drop rewards (bombs, keys, coins)
* fix nodes requiring to hit enter to set their name

### Important

* Zelda like digging enemy
* Diagonal fly
* Work out room layout for hub
* Allow to place entities with editor
* Allow to remove entities with editor
* Rooms that can spawn only in certant biomes
* noise wall room (only possible with path finding)
* Implement settings

#### Polish

* bones and props in the walls
* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Weapons in player hands should drop shadows
* Wall shadow of player should include weapons?
* Low health indicator
* Animate items/creatures falling into the chasm?
* Flash frame for guns
* Make bullets fly out from the right place
* Add sparks
* Think about bloom shader
* Think about blur around edges
* Gore
* Reflections in the water
* Splashes on the water
* Walls after explosion should be "a bit more broken?"
* rework lava, should be like water in chasm or smth
* Props that react to music beats

### Mechanics

* Each level should have its own mechanic, except the starting one (running out of water, turn based movement, etc, allow to choose different roots)
* Explode item stand to replace the item with trash? :thinking:

### Ideas

* cool bonus for killing bk without dropping a single white chunk (health chunk, aka non stop kill)
* make bk himself sign!!!!
* Random events (rain, blood moon, etc), ways to make them more or less likely
* Signs, you can write/read from them
* In-game settings (in lobby) with a sign "We also have normal settings, if you press esc..., but who needs them!?"
* Hub house: long church like building with a huge door in the end, and statues for achievements. Door opens when you finish all achievements. Might also have 1-2 more doors for some amount of achievements complete. Unlocks a new area, maybe new npcs and items
* item combo -> transformation

#### NPCs

### Special rooms

* Challenge room
* Cursed room
* Room with transmutation well (current weapon slot)
* alg for connection rooms that makes a really maze like path but with no branches
