* ice 2 bug when no wall or floor is rendered

* gamepad still shakes even when set to none
* By rolling off the bridge, you can be respawned inside the area with the stairs to the boss rush area before you pay the guard the three emeralds. There is no way to get out without resetting the game,

* weird level tiling, fixed by reloading the level
* sword swinging fast bug fix pls
* error: vallue not found lol (top runs)

???
* music stops when you watch the paintings (it should slowdown)

# hub

* resetting game progress enabled speedrun timer and turned of pixel perfect?

* jungle room generated unpassable
* players might think they are stuck when they dont know that you can break snow

* say something when you end the level
* full clear gives you a point to exit

* axe in small spaces gets broken instantly by the wall
* bk should get harder in next treasure rooms (more you take the harder it is)

* better item display (only last 6, ui for all display)
* add mouth to mimic 
* mistfit poster

* achievement branches rewards {
 a: drums/musical instruments?
 b: 1 hit rip
 c: explosive lamp
 d: sniper
}

* shield class needs a perk, its pretty weak compared to regular

* remove challenges

#

* make reroll machine spawn in item rooms

* redo remapping screens
* shop should start small and grow with donations?
* show only last 6 or so items, allow to see more in pause menu
* this is a secret to everyone easter egg in hub?

* when you pickup glass, fix your broken glass gun/sword
* josh like jokes in settings, with "sound effect"

ice {
 * frozen enemies/troll bomb
 * following troll bomb

}

###

* highlight doors you not went through
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels

### big points that are needed before release (no overscope)

* add soundtrack package to steam
* localisation
* twitch chat integration

#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break
* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* double item stand: 1 good 1 bad
* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
