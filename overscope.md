* mistfit poster
* make secret rooms not so obv

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)
* duck interaction
* dog or some pet, that you can pet, send to can you pet the dog tweet account

flavors {

}

* Broken variant for walls that do not break

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* double item stand: 1 good 1 bad
* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* highlight doors you not went through
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels
* when you pickup glass, fix your broken glass gun/sword
