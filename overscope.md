#### Polish

* make secret rooms not so obv
* shop should start small and grow with donations?
* make reroll machine spawn in item rooms

biome-dependant props (cactuses and dead bushes for desert)

flavors {
 + blood moon (enemies respawn and the game is red)
 + bk flavors
 + fakels in the dark level (like a lot more light sources, turrets should emit light)
}

* Explosion dust in the whole explosion radius, goes from black to white and floats up super fast
* Add sparks
* Splashes on the water
* Props that react to music beats

### Ideas

* disco floor (secret location or just secret room?)
* double item stand: 1 good 1 bad
* last enemy on floor drop reward
* nps that asks for coins but does nothing
* make chests brekable (the ones that you dont have a key to open)
* Unique saving experience for each NPCs (and save phrases)
* a special reward for completing the level fast
* tiles from isaac, that require key to open (basically have doors in some rooms, with pickups behind em)
* item combo -> transformation
* lore through shopkeeper (like in messager)?
* spawn chests/pickups in the levels
* when you pickup glass, fix your broken glass gun/sword
