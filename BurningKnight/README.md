# Burning Knight Content

This is the juicy bit, the content of the game. The quality of code kept drifting lower and lower in the end of the project,
but please, give me some points for even just finishing this massive project.

Have fun exploring the place, I recommend doing it inside of an IDE, Github is not too friendly for exploring huge amount of files.

Here are some starting pointers for you:

* [Player class](https://github.com/egordorichev/BurningKnight/blob/dev/BurningKnight/entity/creature/player/Player.cs)
* [Level class](https://github.com/egordorichev/BurningKnight/blob/dev/BurningKnight/level/Level.cs)
* [InGameState class (main game state)](https://github.com/egordorichev/BurningKnight/blob/dev/BurningKnight/state/InGameState.cs)
